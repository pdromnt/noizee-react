# Noizee (React Port)

An port of the original Noizee in Vue3 to React (also using Tailwind, which previously was purely in hand-made CSS), this project is itself an opensource alternative to Noisli.

## Project setup
Simply use `npm i`.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev
```

### For production
```
npm run build
```
